START at starting layer w/ random board of random thickness and length 
	add board thickness to table width
	if there are boards in reuse_pile
		if reuse_pile contains a board of same thickness
		place board in table grid
	else
		if width of board is wider than 1.5 inch
			cut board lengthwise to 1.5 inch
			
		if remaining_board wider than 1.5 inch
			cut board lengthwise to 1.5 inch
			add to reuse_pile
		else 
			add remaining board to scrap_pile
			place board in table grid
		
	if length of table exceeds specified table length
		go to next board layer with board of random thickness and length
	else 
		repeat loop using same thickness
if width of table exceeds specified width
	end loop
else
	continue loop
